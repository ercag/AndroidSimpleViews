# Android Simple Views

Simple Views is an UI Library for simple and easy to use Android views,
compatible with API 16+(Android 4.1) Apache License 2.0.

The main purpose of this library is to present the basic components needed in many projects by adding new features in a way that is simpler and faster to use, and to create non-built-in views that used in most of the android applications.

I hope it turns into a useful library for everyone..
